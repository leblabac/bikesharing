# NYC Citibike Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analytical project was to prepare visualizations that give potential investors a look into a highly-successful NYC Citibike bike-sharing program, so they can consider a proposed investment in the creation of a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, IA. Visualizations include
- the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- the number of bike trips taken by weekday and by gender, and
- the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
The results of the analysis have been incorporated into a [story on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/laura.blabac/viz/NYCBikesharing_16409893141610/LessonsfromNYCCitiBike)

**Top Starting and Ending Locations**  
Looking closely, the maps of Citibike usage for both starting and ending locations shows that the maps are essentially the same: most active starting locations are also active ending locations for bike users.

**Checkout Times (Duration of Use)**  
The majority of bikes were utilized for periods of less than 1 hour with the majority of rides being 30 minutes or less. While usage is greater among male riders, the pattern is the same regardless of gender.

**Utilization by Gender**  
Male riders utilized bicycles almost three times as often as female riders, the reason for which requires further analysis.  Potential reasons for this may include  safety (perceptions) issues or appearance concerns (i.e. after riding bike to work). Understanding the rationale for less usage by female riders may help increase utilization by this population.

**Usage by Day and Time / Day and Time by Gender**  
There is a clear pattern of bicycle usage during the morning commute (7-9 a.m.) and evening commute (4-7 p.m.) during the week, and all day long on weekends. Although male riders are clearly the majority, female users show a similar pattern of usage.

**Subscription Data**  
Subscriber riders are much more likely to be male, and to a lesser degree female. Those riders identified as customers (i.e. not subscribers) are much less likely to report a gender.

**Bike Utilization**  
Per the current analysis, some bikes have much higher usage. More analysis is needed to determine whether there are predictable patterns to determine which bikes get the highest usage based on number of trips taken and total duration of usage.

## Summary
It is clear that a bike-share program like NYC's Citi Bike program can be a huge success for a city with an active population.  Des Moines is a great prospect for such a program.
